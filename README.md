# REDBUS_APP
For my RedBus project, I used Streamlit to create an app that filters bus data by state, price, ratings, and route names. Data for 10 states was scraped using Selenium and stored in an SQL database. The app provides an easy way to interact with and analyze bus route information efficiently.
